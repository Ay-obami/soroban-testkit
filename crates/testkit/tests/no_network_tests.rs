//! Regression test for the documented no-network test requirement.
//!
//! `BUILD_SPEC.md` §3 puts anything requiring network access at test
//! time out of scope, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` repeats it — but a
//! documented rule nothing enforces is a rule that erodes silently.
//! CI must run every test invocation through
//! `.github/scripts/test-no-network.sh`, which drops the network with
//! `unshare --net` before the suite starts.
